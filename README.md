 building a website about a video game

 For my video game I have picked to do hay day becuase I'm as my friends say I'm addicted

 For my code I used alot of light box code to be able for all my buttons to work and give information on each animal. For each animal they have their own code to make it so they have their own photo and own text.

 I connected my html and css to make it be able to actually work.
